# MEV Bot Production Setup Guide

## 🚀 Overview

This MEV bot implements advanced strategies similar to top MEV searchers like Jaredfromsubway, including:
- **Sandwich Attacks**: Front-run and back-run large trades for profit
- **Cross-DEX Arbitrage**: Exploit price differences across DEXs
- **Bundle Submission**: Uses Flashbots for private transaction submission

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Ethereum Node Access**
   - Recommended: Alchemy, Infura, or QuickNode with WebSocket support
   - Alternative: Run your own node (Geth/Erigon) for lowest latency

2. **Funded Wallet**
   - Minimum: 5 ETH for operations
   - Recommended: 10+ ETH for optimal performance

3. **System Requirements**
   - 8GB+ RAM
   - 4+ CPU cores
   - Low-latency internet connection

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Ethereum Node Configuration
NETWORK_RPC=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
NETWORK_WSS=wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY

# MEV Bot Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Optional: Discord Alerts
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK

# Advanced Settings (Optional)
MIN_PROFIT_WEI=100000000000000000  # 0.1 ETH minimum
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=300
FLASHBOTS_RELAY=https://relay.flashbots.net
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Bot

### Development Mode
```bash
cargo run
```

### Production Mode
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/mev-template
```

### Using Docker
```bash
docker build -t mev-bot .
docker run -d --env-file .env mev-bot
```

## 📊 Strategies Explained

### 1. Sandwich Attack Strategy
- **Detection**: Monitors large swaps with high slippage tolerance
- **Execution**: Places buy order before victim, sell order after
- **Profit**: Captures price movement caused by victim's trade

### 2. Arbitrage Strategy
- **Triangular**: WETH → Token A → Token B → WETH
- **Cross-DEX**: Buy on DEX A, sell on DEX B
- **Multi-hop**: Complex paths across multiple pools

## 🛡️ Risk Management

1. **Gas Price Limits**: Never spend more than 80% of expected profit on gas
2. **Position Sizing**: Maximum 10% of liquidity pool
3. **Simulation**: All opportunities are simulated before execution
4. **Revert Protection**: Transactions that can fail are marked in bundles

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### 1. Node Selection
- Use dedicated nodes or run your own
- Multiple node providers for redundancy
- Geographic proximity to miners

### 2. Code Optimizations
- Parallel transaction analysis
- Efficient sandwich calculations
- Optimized contract calls

### 3. Network Optimization
- Low-latency hosting (AWS/GCP)
- Direct peering with miners
- Multiple Flashbots relays

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logs to Monitor
- Profit/Loss per day
- Gas efficiency
- Bundle inclusion rate
- Failed transactions

### Key Metrics
```
Total Opportunities Found: X
Profitable Opportunities: Y
Executed Bundles: Z
Success Rate: Z/Y
Average Profit: $XXX
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

1. **Private Key Security**
   - Use hardware wallets in production
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

2. **Code Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Audit smart contracts
   - Test on testnets first

3. **Operational Security**
   - Use VPNs/Proxies
   - Distributed infrastructure
   - Backup systems

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Custom Strategies
Implement new strategies by extending the `Strategy` trait:
```rust
pub trait Strategy {
    fn analyze(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Vec<MEVOpportunity>;
    fn execute(&self, opportunity: &MEVOpportunity) -> Result<TxHash>;
}
```

### Pool Management
Add new DEXs by updating the pool detection:
```rust
dex_factories.insert(DexType::NewDex, vec![factory_address]);
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If the bot is losing money:
1. Stop the bot immediately (`Ctrl+C`)
2. Check recent transactions
3. Review logs for errors
4. Adjust parameters before restarting

### If transactions are failing:
1. Check gas prices
2. Verify node connectivity
3. Review smart contract changes
4. Update DEX interfaces if needed
